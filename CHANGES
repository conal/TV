% [TV](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV) changes

## Version 0.3 ##

+  Overhauled to integrate with [Eros](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Eros)
+  Eliminated arrows, in favor of [applicative
   functors](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applicative_functor).  Now
   [Input](src/Interface/TV/Input.hs) takes a type (constructor) parameters:
   `src`, and [Output](src/Interface/TV/Output.hs) takes two type
   (constructor) parameters: `src` & `snk`.
+  Using `LANGUAGE` pragma in place of most `OPTIONS`

## Version 0.2 ##

+  Simplified exports in [TV.hs](src/Interface/TV.hs).  Now just exports by module
   rather than by entity.  Also re-export [DeepArrow] modules.
+  Moved GUI functionality out to a new package [GuiTV].  Removed
   dependency on [Phooey] and (indirectly) [wxHaskell], as the latter can
   be difficult to install. 

## Version 0.1.1 ##

+  Changed all files to *nix-style line endings.

## Version 0.1 ##

+  Removed iEmpty & oEmpty and corresponding constructors. Generate dynamic
   errors earlier rather than later.
+  Removed ICompose & OCompose constructors.  Redefined iCompose and
   oCompose (and consequently fmap on inputs and cofmap on outputs) to work
   only on (possibly titled) primitives.  I don't know how to implement the
   DeepArrow algebra with OCompose.
+  Added wrapO and wrapAO, sort of analogous (or dual) to wrapF.  I'm not
   sure the name is a great choice.  I've also considered "unwrapO".
+  Added readShow, defined via wrapO.
+  Redefined interactRSOut via readShow and renamed "interactLineRS".
   Added "interactRS".
+  Added fromFile & toFile TV functions.
+  Added fileOut
+  Moved Grading example from src/Examples.hs to src/Grading.hs
+  Added "short lines" example to src/Examples.hs.
+  Added type alias RunTV for defining types of runTV specializations, such
   as runUI and runIO.
