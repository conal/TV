Version 0.0:

* Support for Kleisli arrows and IO in particular.

* Grading examples.  I'm very happy with them.

* Added ICompose & OCompose, and used for Functor & Cofunctor instances.  Now
  I have to figure out what the Eros composition operators do with these
  constructors.

* Used fmap/cofmap to define a Read&Show version of interact.

* Made prompts/titles an orthogonal feature (as in Phooey).  Now one can
  title an aggregate.  Required adding constructors to Input & Output.
  Figure out Eros operators.
