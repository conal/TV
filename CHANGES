Version 0.1.1:
* Changed all files to *nix-style line endings.

Version 0.1:
* Removed iEmpty & iEmpty and corresponding constructors. Generate dynamic
  errors earlier rather than later.
* Removed ICompose & OCompose constructors.  Redefined iCompose and
  oCompose (and consequently fmap on inputs and cofmap on outputs) to work
  only on (possibly titled) primitives.  I don't know how to implement the
  DeepArrow algebra with OCompose.
* Added wrapO and wrapAO, sort of analogous (or dual) to wrapF.  I'm not
  sure the name is a great choice.  I've also considered "unwrapO".
* Added readShow, defined via wrapO.
* Redefined interactRSOut via readShow and renamed "interactLineRS".
  Added "interactRS".
* Added fromFile & toFile TV functions.
* Added fileOut 
* Moved Grading example from src/Examples.hs to src/Grading.hs
* Added "short lines" example to src/Examples.hs.
* Added type alias RunTV for defining types of runTV specializations, such
  as runUI and runIO.
