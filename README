TV is a library for visualizing functional values.  It can also be viewed
as an approach to functional user interfaces.  It is implemented very
simply on top of Phooey (http://conal.net/phooey).  The name "TV" comes
"tangible values", which is the central idea of the library.

TV is an intermediate stage between Phooey and Eros
(http://conal.net/papers/Eros).

See tv.cabal for more info, including home page and license.

You can configure, build, generate haddock docs, and install all in the usual
way with Cabal commands.

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

You can also find the Haddock-generated documentation at
