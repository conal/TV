TV is a library for interfacing to functional values.  It can also be
viewed as an approach to functional interfaces.  The name "TV" comes
"tangible values", which is the central idea of the library.  For a fuller
description and link to documentation, please see the project wiki page:

  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV

You can configure, build, generate haddock docs, and install all in the
usual way with Cabal commands.

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

See src/Examples.hs for examples.
