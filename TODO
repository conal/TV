                            To-do items for TV

* Track down the horizontal fill problem that shows up with example tv4.  This is really a problem with Phooey, that I hadn't previousy noticed.  See ui3 in phooey/src/Examples.hs. See if Eros handles it correctly.

* Reconsider some of the differences between Phooey & TV:
** islider has dynamic bounds in Phooey and static in TV.
